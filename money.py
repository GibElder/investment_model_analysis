You are an expert financial analyst.

Below are holdings data from two funds.

{text_etf}


{text_ga}

Please answer the following questions:
Only compare the 60/40 model portfolios from each institution.
1. What are the top 3 holdings where test ETF and test GA differ most in allocation percentage?
2. Which asset classes are most heavily weighted by each institution?
3. What does the turnover since the last rebalance suggest about each portfolio's strategy?
4. Summarize in plain language the main differences between these two portfolios.
5. If an investor prefers stability over aggressive rebalancing, which model may be more suitable and why?
6. what other things can you say about these portfolios based on the data provided that i haven't asked about?
Use only the data provided. Do not speculate beyond this data.


after you asnwer all of that provide some insite where you actually use outside data to provide more context to the analysis.
