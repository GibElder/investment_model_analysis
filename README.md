# Model Portfolio Comparison Tool

This project provides a Python script to clean and compare model portfolio data from two financial institutions using a language model to generate plain language analysis.

---

## Features

- Automatic cleanup of messy CSV files stored in a single column
- Comparison of holdings, allocations, turnover, and asset classes
- Plain language summaries generated by an AI model
- Configurable row limits for large datasets

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas openai
### 2. Set Your API Key
```
```bash
Copy
Edit
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```
### 3. Prepare Data Files
Place your raw CSV files in the project directory:

institution1.csv

institution2.csv

Each file should include a header row starting with:

```pgsql
Copy
Edit
As Of Date, Model Family, Model Portfolio, Asset Class, Ticker, Weighting, Turnover Since Last Rebalance, Fund Name
```
If formats differ, adjust the clean_csv_generic() function in the script.

### 4. Run the Script
```bash
Copy
Edit
python compare_models.py
```
### How It Works
Cleans and parses each CSV file

Converts the data into readable text

Builds a prompt with comparison questions

Sends data to the language model

Prints analysis results in the terminal

Notes
Adjust MAX_ROWS in the script to limit the number of rows included.

Edit the prompt in compare_models.py to customize the questions.

Avoid including sensitive information if using external APIs.

Feel free to modify and adapt this project for your use case.
